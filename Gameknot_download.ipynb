At this point, I'd have expected Nxe5, which I counter with dxe5, but leaving an unprotected pawn out for a possible counterattack, perhaps by Qc7, but my opponent goes for a defensive maneuver instead. } 8. Nxg4 hxg4 9. Qxg4 { With my initiation of the knight exchange, I get a free pawn. } 9... f5 10. Qe2 Qg5 11. g3 e5 12. dxe5 { Getting another free pawn. } 12... Bc5 13. e4 { Getting another free pawn by threatening the queen like this. } 13... Qg6 14. exf5 Qh7 15. f6 Qh3 { At this point my pawn is so close to getting promoted I totally expected gxf6. That does technically allow me to do exf6+, but I'm not sure why my opponent did this instead of doing Qg8 or something else. } 16. Bg6+ Kd8 17. fxg7 { Getting another free pawn. } 17... Rg8 18. Bg5+ Kc7 19. Bf6 { Here my bishop supports both my e pawn and my g pawn. This bishop ends up being a hard worker in the endgame! xD } 19... Qg2 20. Rf1 Ba6 21. Bd3 { Rather clever move by Black, if only I hadn't still had my own bishop to trade. } 21... Bc4 22. Bxc4 dxc4 23. Qxc4 { Rather than Black doing Bxd3, they instead let me initiate the exchange and I claim another free pawn. } 23... Nd7 24. b4 { Dead bishop now, so Black at least has it take a pawn to lessen the material lost. } 24... Bxb4 25. Qxb4 a5 26. Qd6+ Kc8 27. f3 { Blocking the queen from accessing the diagonal. } 27... Nc5 28. Qxc6+ { Claiming another free pawn. } 28... Kb8 29. Qxb6+ { And getting another free pawn. } 29... Nb7 { This knight was the LITERAL BANE OF MY EXISTENCE in the endgame; so many checkmates were prevented by it. } 30. O-O-O a4 31. Rd8+ Rxd8 32. Bxd8 { Exchange of material. At this point, Black could have easily done Qxf1+ and regained some control (and some material) but they didn't see it? } 32... Ra5 { I think Black wanted to do Rxe5 on the next move but instead this just results in a dead rook; in a few more turns, the bishop gets the rook. } 33. Qc7+ Ka8 34. Rd1 { Moving the rook to prevent Qxf1+. } 34... Qxf3 { Black takes a free pawn but the endgame is already in progress. } 35. g8=Q { I legit forgot about that pawn being ready to promote until now. xD } 35... a3 { Maybe Black wants to try and promote their own pawn? } 36. Qc8+ { Endgame begins; from here, it's a forced mate, essentially. } 36... Ka7 37. Bxa5 { The rook here prevented a lot of moves I wanted to do so I had to get rid of it. } 1-0\n"
